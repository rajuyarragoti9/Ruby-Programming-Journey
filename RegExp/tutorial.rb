1. 'abcd' =~ /abcd/

This checks if the string 'abcd' matches the exact pattern /abcd/.
The regular expression /abcd/ will match the string 'abcd', 
so it returns the index of where the match starts (0 in this case).

'abcd' =~ /ab[cg][db]/
This pattern checks if 'abcd' matches the regular expression /ab[cg][db]/.
[cg] matches either c or g, 
and [db] matches either d or b.
In the string 'abcd', the substring 'ab' is followed by c and d, so it matches.
Returns the index of the match (0).

'abcd' =~ /[a-z]*/

/[a-z]*/ matches zero or more lowercase letters.
This will match 'abcd' because it contains lowercase letters, 
and the * allows for zero occurrences as well (so an empty string would also match).
It returns the index of where the match starts (0).

'abcd' =~ /[a-z]*1/
/[a-z]*1/ matches zero or more lowercase letters, followed by a 1.
This won't match 'abcd' because it doesn't end with a 1. 
It returns nil because there is no match.

'abcd1' =~ /[a-z]*[0-9]+/
/[a-z]*[0-9]+/ matches zero or more lowercase letters followed by one or more digits.
It matches 'abcd1' because 'abcd' is followed by a 1, which is a digit. 
It returns the index of the match (0).

'abcd1' =~ /[a-z]*[0-9]+/

This is the same as the previous one ('abcd1' =~ /[a-z]*[0-9]+/),
 so the explanation is identical: it matches 'abcd1' and returns the match index (0).
'abcd1' =~ /[a-z]*\d?/

/[a-z]*\d?/ matches zero or more lowercase letters followed by an optional digit.
It matches 'abcd1' because 'abcd' is followed by the digit 1. 
The \d? part allows for zero or one digit, so it matches.
Returns the index of the match (0).

'abcd' =~ /^\w{4}$/
/^\w{4}$/ matches exactly four word characters (letters, digits, or underscores) from the start (^) to the end ($) of the string.
It matches 'abcd' because it contains exactly four word characters,
 so it returns the index of the match (0).

 'abcd' =~ /a(.*)d/
 /a(.*)d/ matches a string that starts with a, followed by any number of characters (.*), and ends with d.
It matches 'abcd' because it starts with a and ends with d, 
and the .* can match any characters in between. It returns the index of the match (0).



Summary of Ruby's =~ operator:
The =~ operator checks if a string matches a regular expression.
If a match is found, it returns the index of the start of the match (0-based).
If no match is found, it returns nil.
